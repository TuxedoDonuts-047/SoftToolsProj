The following is a representartion of the user flow, where it starts the application, showing a login screen, 
once logged it brings you to a UI page where you can select Library to view already rented or purchased movies/shows 
or you can select store where ti brings you to a store full of non purchased/rented movies/shows. From here the user 
can select a mvoie to watch or view transaction history (the library) or if the dstore is chosen the user is broguht 
to the dtore to rent or buy a movie or show. Then once selected the user brought to the checkout where they can purchase 
or rent the selevted movie, and/or return to the store page to add more. Once checkout is selected the user is brought 
to a checkout page where they can purchase or rent the selection and once complete the user is broguht back to the store page.
If the user is staff however, the above is the same except they have access to an edit store page where they can edit pricing and or/other elements.
